# Grow-Me-Organic-Parser-B2C
Script for uploding B2C companies data from Growmeorganic.com

Automation was necessary because of poor optimization of data unloading from the site, for B2C it's even worse than first time. There was no way to combine many identical queries into one. For example, about 150 queries were required to obtain data on companies of all possible industries and sizes for one country alone. The presented script made it possible to automate the unloading of data on B2B companies throughout Europe.
